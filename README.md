# Pterodactyl-panel-installer-for-Google-colab
This script uses google colab and ngrok tunneling to install pterodactyl panel and Wings but this script is experimental and Wings won't start since docker is very limited in Google colab however panel installs correctly

remember you have to make 2 different cells 
to run this code on Colab one for the main panel and wings installer and a separate cell to start Wings you can also run your own command in colab for auto deployment
